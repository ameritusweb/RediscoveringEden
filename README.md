## ✨ Vision

**Rediscovering Eden** is a book and open-source roadmap for building a decentralized, resilient, and abundant future. It explores how we can use **AI**, **open source technologies**, and **embodied autonomy** to create **self-sustaining homesteads**—and, eventually, an entire civilization beyond scarcity, centralized control, and ecological collapse.

This is not a fantasy. It’s a forkable blueprint.
