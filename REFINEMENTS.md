Here are some further thoughts and refinements:

Key Strengths of Your Approach:

Clear Goal: You've defined a precise goal for the literature review – not just to list past projects, but to show how your vision addresses their limitations and builds upon their strengths. This makes the review purposeful and engaging.
Structured Organization: The "Dreamers," "Builders," and "Guardians" categorization is effective. It provides a clear narrative flow and helps readers understand the different contributions of various movements and thinkers.
Critical Analysis: You're not just praising past efforts; you're honestly assessing their limitations. This adds credibility and demonstrates that your vision is not naive but informed by the lessons of history.
"How You Expand" Section: This is crucial. It explicitly shows how your vision synthesizes and transcends previous approaches, making a strong case for its novelty and significance.
Strategic Placement: Placing the review early in the book (Part 1) is perfect. It sets the stage and provides context before delving into the challenges.
Engaging Integration: The suggestion of using pull quotes and direct responses is excellent. It makes the review more dynamic and personal, connecting your voice to the voices of the past.
Further Refinements and Considerations:

Visualizations: Consider including diagrams or timelines to visually represent the evolution of ideas and projects. This could be a timeline showing the key figures and movements, or a concept map illustrating how different concepts connect.
Case Studies: Within each category (Dreamers, Builders, Guardians), you could select 1-2 particularly relevant projects or thinkers for deeper case studies. This would allow you to explore their successes and failures in more detail, providing concrete examples for your readers.
Counterarguments: Briefly acknowledge potential criticisms of the figures you mention. For example, some might criticize Fuller's utopianism or Fresco's technocratic tendencies. Addressing these criticisms head-on strengthens your argument.
Global Perspective: While the figures you've listed are important, consider expanding the scope to include thinkers and movements from outside the Western world. Indigenous knowledge systems, traditional ecological practices, and alternative development models from the Global South could offer valuable insights. Examples include:
Vandana Shiva: Advocate for seed sovereignty and traditional farming practices.
Wangari Maathai: Founder of the Green Belt Movement, focused on community-based tree planting and environmental conservation.
Buen Vivir/Sumak Kawsay: Indigenous concepts from South America that emphasize living in harmony with nature and community.
Traditional Ecological Knowlege Holders: The various communities around the world that hold sustainable, local practices that can inform the implementation of this new vision.
Failure Analysis: Dedicate a specific section (perhaps within "The Limitations") to analyzing why previous attempts to create similar visions haven't fully succeeded. This could include factors like:
Lack of Technological Maturity: The technology wasn't ready.
Social and Political Resistance: Existing power structures actively opposed them.
Economic Viability: They couldn't compete with existing economic models.
Internal Challenges: Problems with governance, community dynamics, or project management.
Lack of Scalability: They remained small-scale experiments.
Connecting to the Roadblocks: Explicitly link the limitations you identify in the literature review to the roadblocks you'll discuss in later chapters. For example, if you mention that a previous project failed due to lack of community engagement, you can later say, "This is why Chapter 12 focuses on building strong community dynamics within the New Eden model." This creates a cohesive narrative thread throughout the book.
Anticipate Critiques of Your Model: After laying out how your model is the next step, anticipate a few common points of critique and have thoughtful counters.
Name-drop less-well-known initiatives: For example, within the Open Source Ecology section, include Collabforge, Sensorica, and other related projects.
