# Chapter 4: The Grip of Centralization

## The Power Structure
### Corporate Control

- Financial institution concentration
- How monopolies self-reinforce

### Government Entanglement
- Regulatory capture
- Military-industrial complex
- Surveillance partnerships
- Public-private power networks
- How legislation protects centralization

### Infrastructure Lock-in

- The importance of preparation
- The power of networked resistance
- The path to true autonomy

This chapter examines how centralized power actively resists decentralization efforts, while also showing its inherent vulnerabilities and how they can be strategically addressed.
